        Hello rising Senior Hornets,
        Thank you for listening to every candidate's campaign over the past week or so. However, I think as a rising Senior, you should choose me to be one of your Senior Rep candidates. 
        I think this because of the multitude of ideas that I have that can change the school for the better in the future. Some ideas that I have are as follows: 
        <ul style="color:white; font-weight: normal">
            <li>Creative Spirit Days (Spotify Wrapped Day, Color Clash Day, Twin with a Teacher Day, and more!)</li>
            <li>More APs that revolve around Hornet interest (Home EC classes, Financial Literacy, Music Production)</li>
            <li>Using official Midwood pages to popularize events and tools in the community (Sports Events, AP Night, the "Complaint Box" in the COSA office)</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: white; font-weight: normal">More ideas that I have are fundraising with fun nights in the school such as Teacher vs. Student nights, along with Creator of the Month opportunities that involve showcasing the art that Midwood students make.
        This upcoming election is the last time that the CO25 Hornets can vote, which is why I suggest you use your vote wisely, and vote for me on May 25th.

        Thank you for reading!

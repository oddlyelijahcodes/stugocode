        Hello! It's nice to meet all rising seniors. For the next week and some change, I will be running to ensure that the people of Midwood get a Senior Rep that listens to their voices and concerns.
        However, I thought it would be a nice idea for all rising seniors to meet me as their rep before the Elections start.
        As a rising Senior, you may know me as a member of the Wrestling team, or the Lacrosse team, or you may even know me because I've showed up to one of your games. This year, I want to be one of your Senior Representatives!
        Here are some fun facts about me:
        <br>
        <ol style="color: white">
            <li>I play Defense on Lacrosse (#36), and I wrestle.</li>
            <li>My favorite color is red</li>
            <li>My favorite thing to do in my free time is code.</li>
            <li>I listen to a lot of music: my favorite genres are alt rap, neo-soul, and r&b.</li>
            <li>My favorite sports to play in my free time are Basketball and Lacrosse.</li>
            <li>My dream job is to work in Computer Science. That's the main reason why I made this website!</li>
        </ol>

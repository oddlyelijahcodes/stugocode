<p><h2 style="color: white; font-size: large;">Rising Senior Hornets: I am so delighted to bring you this website that I started to code in May of 2023. Over the past year, I have observed problems within Midwood's environment, and although Midwood is a beautiful school as it is, improvements can be made to help the school out and make it a better place for current and future Hornets.

    I'd like to start off with the ideas that I have. These ideas are of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>Creative Spirit Days (Spotify Wrapped Day, Color Clash Day, Twin with a Teacher Day, and more!)</li>
    <li>More APs that revolve around Hornet interest (Home EC classes, Financial Literacy, Music Production)</li>
    <li>Using official Midwood pages to popularize events and tools in the community (Sports Events, AP Night, the "Complaint Box" in the COSA office)</li>
    <li>Establishing a peer tutoring program that rewards students with credits for tutoring other students. This can be implemented in a club such as My Brother's/Sister's Keeper</li>
    <li>Organizing nights around the school and with other schools (ex. Midwood Teachers vs. Murrow Teachers in Basketball, Midwood Teachers vs. Midwood Students in a Jeopardy game) </li>
</ul>
    This is just an overview of what's to come. If you'd like to check out other sections of my page, or even an introduction on who I am, look at <a href="page2.html" style="color: white" target="blank" title="This will take you to the Get to Know Me page!">
